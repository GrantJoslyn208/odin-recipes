    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish beloved for its rich layers of flavor and comforting appeal. Typically made with sheets of pasta, lasagna is assembled with alternating layers of savory fillings such as seasoned ground meat or vegetables, creamy ricotta or béchamel sauce, and robust marinara or bolognese sauce. Generously topped with melted cheese, often mozzarella and Parmesan, it is baked to golden perfection, creating a delightful harmony of textures—soft pasta, gooey cheese, and a slightly crispy top layer. While the traditional recipe is a staple, variations abound, including vegetarian versions with spinach and zucchini or decadent renditions with seafood. Whether served at family dinners or festive gatherings, lasagna embodies warmth and togetherness, making it a universal favorite.</p>
