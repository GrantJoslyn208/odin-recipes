    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Curry is a flavorful and aromatic dish originating from South Asia, now enjoyed worldwide in various forms. It typically consists of a rich, spiced sauce made with a combination of ingredients such as turmeric, cumin, coriander, ginger, garlic, and chili. Curries can feature a variety of proteins, including chicken, lamb, beef, seafood, or plant-based options like lentils, chickpeas, or tofu. Vegetables are often included, adding texture and balance to the dish. Curry sauces range from creamy and mild to fiery and robust, depending on the regional style and ingredients. It is traditionally served with rice or bread, such as naan or roti, to soak up the flavorful sauce.</p>
